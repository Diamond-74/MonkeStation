changes:
  - bugfix: Fixes the shutter buttons in Metastation R&D
  - tweak: Minor changes to robotics (IE the surgical tools for roboticists spawn
      in a surgical duffel, robotics' windows are all electrified and made of reinforced
      glass in parity with the rest of the department, etc)
  - rscadd: Adds a lovely engineering service desk with shutter so you can serve people
      without letting their disgusting filth into your place of work
  - bugfix: Adjusts the doors that govern access to Engineering's foyer and lathe,
      _(Previously, when you wanted the HOP to give you access to engineering, he
      actually needed to grant "Engineering" and "Construction" to let you in the
      front door, now people granted the "Engineering" access can access the lathe)_
  - rscadd: Adds a secret safe hidden behind the clown poster, this is a deep, philosophical
      nod to how the mime is overshadowed by the clown
  - tweak: Improves lighting conditions of the kitchen at the behest of LME
